// Package baas defines a provider-agnostic Banking-as-a-Service rail: the NGN
// fiat in/out used by Route B (decentralized LP) and Route C (managed float).
//
// The concrete provider (today the BaaS provider MFB) lives behind the Provider
// interface and provider-neutral domain types declared here. All app code —
// the auto-pay loop, the admin funding console, the reconcile cron, the LP
// balance endpoint — depends ONLY on this package, never on a vendor SDK. To
// switch providers, implement Provider in a new adapter and select it in the
// composition root (main.go); no consumer changes.
//
// Status normalisation is part of the contract: each adapter maps its vendor's
// status vocabulary onto TransferStatus so consumers branch on a stable enum,
// not on vendor strings.
